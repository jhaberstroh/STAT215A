         name is cfg.yml. The necessary variables to set are:
      config/dir - Absolute path to the directory containing lab4. Scripts have access to dir/R/.
      config/data - Absolute path to the directory containing image{1..3}.txt. Example scripts
            will not try to access files other than image{1..3}.txt.

   3. Run all of the R scripts in the scripts directory to generate the figures necessary for
         the writeup. If running interactively, please set interactive = TRUE and set variable
         args$config to the name of your configuration file. If running as a script, provide 
         the name of your configuration file with the -c argument.

         system's Latex complier to generate the document.
